## General Information
A service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free is known as a bike-sharing system. Many such systems allow people to borrow a bike from a mostly computer-controlled "dock" wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dip in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. In order to accelerate its revenue after the lockdown, the company wants to understand the demand for shared bikes after the Covid quarantine ends. They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. With the help of a service provider firm they have gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions
Most important factors affecting the demand of bikes are:
- Conclusion 2 
- Conclusion 3 
- Conclusion 4 
The model can be further analyzed as a polynomial model to get better results from linear model.
